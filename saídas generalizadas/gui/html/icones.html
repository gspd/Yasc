        <h1>Icons</h1>

        For the development of a computational grid, the user has at his disposal some icons that are essential. These icons are located in a specific bar, see Figure 1.

        <img src="imagens/barra_icones.png" width="450" height="50" alt="Icon bar" border="0"> 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The first icon represents a machine, a computing element that can be used either as a slave who will process information, or a master scheduler will be responsible for scheduling tasks.
